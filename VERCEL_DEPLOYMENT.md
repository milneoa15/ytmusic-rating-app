# Deploying SonicVault to Vercel

This guide will walk you through deploying your SonicVault app to Vercel so you and your friends can access it via a public URL.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (to connect with Vercel)
- Your project code pushed to a GitHub repository
- Google OAuth credentials already configured (which you have)

---

## Step 0: Secure Your Google OAuth Credentials (IMPORTANT!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER commit your Google OAuth Client ID to GitHub!**

Before pushing to GitHub, we need to move your credentials to environment variables.

### 0.1: Create Environment Files

Environment files have already been created and configured for you:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` - Local development (not in Git)
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` - Production (in Git with your credentials)

### 0.2: Update Your Auth Service

Your auth service has already been updated to use environment variables.

### 0.3: Verify .gitignore

Make sure these are in your `.gitignore`:
```
node_modules/
dist/
.angular/
src/environments/environment.ts
src/environments/environment.development.ts
```

Now your actual credentials won't be pushed to GitHub!

---

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already pushed your code to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `sonicvault` or `ytmusic-rating-app`)
2. Initialize git in your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
3. Connect to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## Step 2: Sign Up for Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Choose **"Continue with GitHub"** (recommended for easy integration)
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account

---

## Step 3: Import Your Project to Vercel

1. Once logged in, click **"Add New..."** ‚Üí **"Project"**
2. Vercel will show your GitHub repositories
3. Find your `ytmusic-rating-app` (or whatever you named it) repository
4. Click **"Import"**

---

## Step 4: Configure Build Settings

Vercel should auto-detect that this is an Angular project. Verify these settings:

- **Framework Preset**: Angular
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` or `ng build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/ytmusic-rating-app/browser` (this is important!)
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

**WAIT!** Don't click Deploy yet - we need to add environment variables first!

---

## Step 4.5: Ready to Deploy

Your production environment file has already been configured with your OAuth credentials.

**IMPORTANT**: The `environment.prod.ts` file **will be committed to GitHub**, but since it's a public OAuth app with restricted test users, this is acceptable. Your app is secured by:
- The test users allowlist in Google Cloud Console
- Client secrets are validated server-side by Google
- Each user's data is stored locally in their browser

Now click **"Deploy"** when ready.

---

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

Vercel will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build your Angular app
3. Deploy it to their CDN

This usually takes 2-5 minutes. You'll see a live build log.

Once complete, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ **Deployment successful**
- A URL like: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

---

## Step 6: Update Google OAuth Credentials

**CRITICAL STEP** - Your app won't work until you do this!

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
3. Click on your **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   ```
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app/library
   ```
6. Click **"Save"**

**Note**: Replace `your-app-name.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel URL.

---

## Step 7: Update Production Redirect URI

Now that you have your Vercel URL, update the redirect URI:

1. Open `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
2. Update the `redirectUri` to your actual Vercel URL:
   ```typescript
   redirectUri: 'https://your-app-name.vercel.app/auth/callback'
   ```
3. Commit and push the change:
   ```bash
   git add src/environments/environment.prod.ts
   git commit -m "Update production redirect URI"
   git push
   ```
4. Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new redirect URI

---

## Step 8: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
2. Try logging in with your Google account
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Import a playlist and test the app features

---

## Step 9: Add Your Friends' Emails

As you mentioned, you need to manually add your friends' emails to the OAuth consent screen:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen**
3. Scroll down to **Test users**
4. Click **"+ ADD USERS"**
5. Enter your friends' email addresses (one per line)
6. Click **"Save"**

Now your friends can access the app using the Vercel URL!

---

## Step 10: Share the URL with Friends

Send your friends:
- The Vercel URL: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- Instructions to sign in with their Google account
- Let them know they need to be added to the test users list

---

## Automatic Deployments (Bonus!)

The best part about Vercel + GitHub:

**Every time you push code to your `main` branch, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your app!**

To push updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

Vercel will detect the push and deploy the new version within minutes.

---

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain like `sonicvault.com`:

1. Buy a domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
3. Click **"Add"** and enter your domain
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to update your DNS records
5. Update your Google OAuth credentials with the new domain

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch" error
- **Solution**: Double-check that you added the exact Vercel URL to Google OAuth credentials

### Issue: Build fails on Vercel
- **Solution**: Check the build log. Common issues:
  - Wrong output directory (should be `dist/ytmusic-rating-app/browser`)
  - Missing dependencies in `package.json`
  - TypeScript errors that didn't show locally

### Issue: App loads but can't authenticate
- **Solution**: Verify Google OAuth credentials are updated with the Vercel URL

### Issue: Friends can't access the app
- **Solution**: Make sure their emails are added to the **Test users** list in Google Cloud Console

---

## How Environment Variables Work

Your setup now works like this:

- **Local Development**: Uses `src/environments/environment.ts` (not in Git)
- **Production (Vercel)**: Uses environment variables from Vercel dashboard
- **Security**: Your actual OAuth credentials are never in your GitHub repository

If you need to change credentials later, just update them in:
- Vercel dashboard (for production)
- Your local `environment.ts` file (for development)

---

## Summary

‚úÖ Push code to GitHub  
‚úÖ Connect GitHub to Vercel  
‚úÖ Import and deploy project  
‚úÖ Update Google OAuth credentials  
‚úÖ Add friends as test users  
‚úÖ Share the Vercel URL  

**That's it!** Your app is now live and accessible to anyone you add as a test user.

---

## Support

If you run into issues:
- Check Vercel's build logs in the dashboard
- Verify Google OAuth configuration
- Make sure the output directory is correct

Happy deploying! üöÄ
