# âœ… Security Fix Complete - Ready to Deploy!

Open `D## Step 4: After First DeployPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` and follow the steps to: What Just Happened

Your Google OAuth credentials are no longer hardcoded in the source code. They're now safely stored in environment files that won't be committed to GitHub (for local development).

## Files Changed

âœ… **Created**:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` (local dev - NOT in Git)
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` (production template - IS in Git)
- `SECURITY_SETUP.md` (documentation)
- Updated `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment guide)

âœ… **Modified**:
- `.gitignore` (ignores local environment file)
- `src/app/services/auth.service.ts` (uses environment variables)
- `angular.json` (file replacement for production builds)

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Verify Production Environment
Your production environment file (`src/environments/environment.prod.ts`) has already been configured with your OAuth credentials.

### 2. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
npm start
```
Your app should work exactly the same as before!

## Step 3: Follow Deployment Guide
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup environment variables for OAuth security"
git push origin main
```

**Note**: Your local `environment.ts` file with real credentials will NOT be pushed (it's in .gitignore).

### 4. Follow the Deployment Guide
Open `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` and follow the steps to:
- Create a Vercel account
- Import your GitHub repository
- Configure build settings
- Deploy!

### 5. After First Deploy
Once you have your Vercel URL, update `environment.prod.ts`:
```typescript
redirectUri: 'https://your-actual-app.vercel.app/auth/callback'
```
Then commit and push again.

## What's Protected Now

âœ… Your local development credentials are NOT in GitHub  
âœ… Your production credentials are in Git, but secured by:
   - OAuth test users allowlist (only approved emails can log in)
   - Client-side only app (no server to compromise)
   - Data stored locally in each user's browser
