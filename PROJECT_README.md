## ðŸ”§ API Integration (Next Steps)

The application is structured with placeholder methods for YouTube Music API integration. To connect to the real YouTube Music API:

### 1. Authentication (auth.service.ts)
Update the `loginWithYouTube()` method:
```typescript
// Replace mock implementation with:
- YouTube OAuth 2.0 flow
- Token management
- Refresh token handling
```

### 2. YouTube Music Service (youtube-music.service.ts)
Replace mock methods with actual API calls:
- `getUserPlaylists()` - Fetch user's playlists
- `getPlaylistSongs()` - Get songs from a playlist
- `createPlaylist()` - Create new playlist
- `addSongsToPlaylist()` - Add songs to playlist

### Required API Setup:
1. Register app in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable YouTube Data API v3
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Configure authorized redirect URIs
5. Implement proper error handling

## ðŸ’¾ Data Storage

Currently uses **localStorage** for ratings:

```typescript
{
  "ytmusic_ratings": {
    "[userId]": {
      "[songId]": {
        "songId": string,
        "userId": string,
        "rating": number,
        "ratedAt": Date
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Production:
- Move to backend database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Implement proper user authentication
- Enable cloud sync across devices
